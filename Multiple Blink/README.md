This program causes multiple LEDs to blink at different rates. The microprocessors used are the MSP430G2553 and the MSP432P401R. The MSP430G2553 uses the MSP430.h header file while the MSP432P401R uses the more generic MSP.h header file. Both programs stop the watchdog timer to prevent the system from resetting. Both programs use infinite loops and declare a volatile unsigned int to be used for looping.
