The general idea of the program is to have an LED blink. The microprocessors used for this simple blink are the MSP430G2553 and the MSP430FR2311. Both microcontrollers have very similar codes in terms of function and they both use a generic MSP430 header file. This was coded using Code Composer Studio 8 in a CCS project. Both codes start with stopping the watchdog timer, which resets the system if a software problem occurs. Both codes have a P1DIR set to 1 so that P1.0 is set as an output (LED). Both codes also have an infinite loop where a statement toggles the LED on or off using a XOR with a one to the bit zero followed by a loop that runs 50000 times to cause a delay. These delay loops have a volatile unsigned int that decrements by one each iteration.

The MSP430G2553 simple blink code is more efficient where the infinite while loop contains one line for loop causing the delay. The condition for the delay loop is that the variable must be greater than zero to be true. The MSP430FR2311 requires a line after stopping the watchdog timer. This statement "PM5CTL0 &= ~LOCKLPM5;" disables the default high impedance mode and unlocks the GPIO pins for use. The infinite loop is a for loop that contains a do loop. The condition for the do loop is that the variable must not be equal to zero to be true.
